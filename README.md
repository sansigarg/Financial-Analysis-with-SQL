# Financial-Analysis-with-SQL
This GitHub repository contains the solution for the Rosas Palas Franchise accounting project. In this project, students are given read-only access to an existing accounting database, H_Accounting, and are tasked with creating Profit and Loss (P&amp;L) and Balance Sheet (B/S) statements through SQL queries and stored procedures.
